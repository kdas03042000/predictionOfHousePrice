# predictionOfHousePrice
This project is based on multiple linear regression and it's applied on multiple input features to predict the output closer to the target value.
As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression in used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The independent variables can be continuous or categorial.
Here we have a dataset where the independent paarameteres are 'Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms', 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms' and 'Area Population' and the dependent parameter is 'Price'.
